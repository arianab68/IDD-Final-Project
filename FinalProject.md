## Big Idea
![PeePass-logos_black](https://github.com/ironclock/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/assets/82296790/25d9c15c-d581-4b26-b052-30df17db408d)



PeePass is a mobile application that connects users to nearby business restrooms offering clean toilets through an application interface and proprietary locking mechanism on bathroom doors.

## Objective

Our objective is to create a 3D miniature bathroom setting with would simulate the experience of a user journey using PeePass. The model would include a life size lock on the 'door' that would unlock using a prototype version of the PeePass app and an NFC Reader connected to our Raspberry Pi. Most importantly, for fun, we plan to include lasers inside the bathroom when the door is locked. The lasers are deactivated when the door is unlocked.

## Deliverables

1. Project plan: Big idea, timeline, parts needed, fall-back plan.

### Project Plan:

### 1. Conceptualization and Design (Week 1)

- **Designing the App Interface:** Basic functionality for NFC scanning and keypad code entry.
- **3D Bathroom Model Design:** Plan the dimensions, placement of the door lock, and interior details like the toilet and bathtub.
- **Laser System Conceptualization:** Determine the placement and type of lasers and how they will be integrated.

### 2. Development and Procurement (Weeks 2-3)

- **iOS App Development:**
    - Setup a basic user interface.
    - Implement NFC reading functionality.
    - Integrate keypad input with a 4-digit code system.
- **3D Model Printing:**
    - Finalize the design and start 3D printing components.
- **Raspberry Pi Setup:**
    - Program the Pi to respond to NFC scans and keypad inputs.
    - Integrate the electric strike lock.
- **Laser System Setup:**
    - Source the lasers and any necessary wiring (fishing wire or fiber optics).
    - Install and test the laser system within the model.

### 3. Assembly and Testing (Week 4)

- **Assemble the Bathroom Model:**
    - Install the electric strike lock and connect it to the Raspberry Pi.
    - Place the interior model pieces.
    - Set up the laser system.
- **Integration Testing:**
    - Test the iOS app with the NFC reader and keypad on the Raspberry Pi.
    - Ensure the lock mechanism works correctly.
    - Test the visibility and alignment of the laser system.

### 4. Final Adjustments and Presentation (Week 5)

- **Troubleshooting and Adjustments:**
    - Address any issues found during testing.
    - Make adjustments to the hardware or software as necessary.
- **Final Review and Demonstration:**
    - Prepare a demonstration setup.
    - Review the project against initial objectives and specifications.

3. Functioning project: The finished project should be a device, system, interface, etc. that people can interact with.

4. Documentation of design process
5. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)
6. Video of someone using your project
7. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)

8. Group work distribution questionnaire

## Change of Design

It is fine to change your project goals, but please resubmit the project plan for the new design when you do that.

## Grading rubric

20% Project planning: Allocation of needed resources (time, people, materials, facilities) anticipated well.
20% Design of project: Interaction, hardware and software aspects of projects planned well.
20% Testing of project: Functional or wizarded system tested with people
20% Prototype functionality: System capable of interaction, either through autonomous or wizarded mechanisms
20% Project documentation: Text, video, and photo of project illustratign capability and documenting plans and process

## Teams

You can and are not required to work in teams. Be clear in documentation who contributed what. The total project contributions should reflect the number of people on the project.
